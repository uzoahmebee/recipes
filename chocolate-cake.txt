1-2 Chocolate Cake is a simple, fairly easy chocolate cake recipe.

Ingredients[edit]
⅓ cup (80 ml) vegetable oil
2 ounces (55 g) unsweetened chocolate
1 cup sugar (or ½ cup)
1 egg
1¼ cups (300 g) whole wheat flour
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon vanilla extract
¾ cup (180 ml) water
¾ cup (180 g) semi-sweet chocolate pieces (such as chocolate chips)
½ cup (120 g) chopped nuts
(Optional: 4 ounces (115 g) cream cheese or sour cream)

Procedure
Put the oil and chocolate in an 8 in (20 cm) square pan and set it in 350 °F (180 °C) oven just until the chocolate melts. (Add sour cream or cream cheese if desired.)
Add remaining ingredients, except chocolate chips and nuts, to the pan.
Beat with a fork until smooth and creamy (about 2 minutes).
Scrape the sides of the pan, and spread the batter evenly in the pan.
Sprinkle with chocolate chips and nuts. Optionally, cut the chocolate chips and nuts into the batter to some extent.
Bake at 350 °F (180 °C) for 30 to 40 minutes, until a toothpick stuck in the center comes out clean.
Cool in pan; eat hot or cooled.
